		</li>
		<li>
			<em>Location data.</em> We collect location data such as information about your device's location,

	<p>
		The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and UK GDPR require us to explain the valid legal
		bases we rely on in order to process your personal information. As such, we may rely on the
		following legal bases to process your personal information:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<strong>Consent. </strong>We may process your information if you have given us permission
			(i.e. consent) to use your personal information for a specific purpose. You can withdraw your
			consent at any time. <a href="#withdrawconsent">Click here to learn more. </a>
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Legitimate Interests.</strong> We may process your information when we believe it is
			reasonably necessary to achieve our legitimate interests and those interests do not outweigh
			your interests and fundamental rights and freedoms. For example, we may process your personal
			information for some of the purposes described in order to:
			<ul>
				<li>Analyse how our service is used so we can improve it to engage and retain users</li>
				<li>Diagnose problems and/or prevent fraudulent activities</li>
				<li>Understand how our users use our service so we can improve user experience</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Legal Obligations.</strong> We may process your information where we believe it is
			necessary for compliance with our legal obligations, such as to cooperate with a law
			enforcement body or regulatory agency, exercise or defend our legal rights, or disclose your
			information as evidence in litigation in which we are involved.<br />
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Vital Interests.</strong> We may process your information where we believe it is necessary
			to protect your vital interests or the vital interests of a third party, such as situations involving
			potential threats to the safety of any person.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<strong><u><em>If you are located in Canada, this section applies to you. </em></u></strong>
	<p class="sub">
		We may process your information if you have given us specific permission (i.e. express consent)
		to use your personal information for a specific purpose, or in situations where your permission

	<p>
		In some exceptional cases, we may be legally permitted under applicable law to process your
		information without your consent, including, for example:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			If collection is clearly in the interests of an individual and consent cannot be obtained in a
			timely way
		</li>
		<li>For investigations and fraud detection and prevention</li>
		<li>For business transactions provided certain conditions are met</li>
		<li>
			If it is contained in a witness statement and the collection is necessary to assess, process,
			or settle an insurance claim
		</li>
		<li>For identifying injured, ill, or deceased persons and communicating with next of kin</li>
		<li>
			If we have reasonable grounds to believe an individual has been, is, or may be victim of
			financial abuse
		</li>
		<li>
			If it is reasonable to expect collection and use with consent would compromise the
			availability or the accuracy of the information and the collection is reasonable for purposes
			related to investigating a breach of an agreement or a contravention of the laws of Canada or
			a province
		</li>
		<li>
			If disclosure is required to comply with a subpoena, warrant, court order, or rules of the
			court relating to the production of records
		</li>
		<li>
			If it was produced by an individual in the course of their employment, business, or profession
			and the collection is consistent with the purposes for which the information was produced
		</li>
		<li>If the collection is solely for journalistic, artistic, or literary purposes</li>

		When we have no ongoing legitimate need to process your personal information, we will either
